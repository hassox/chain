h1. Chain

Chain is a convention for building web applications.  Why Another One?  Events.

The conventions to date for making web applications are callstack based.

<pre>
function
  -> function
    -> function
      ->  function
        <- return
      <- return
    <- return
  <- return
</pre>

For any rubyists this is great, it's how rack works.  Call a method and return a value.  Easy.  This is a callstack structure.  Any exception raised or thrown in downstream methods can be caught and delt with.  You know what you're getting, and the request is assured to pass through so you can modify it when it comes back up the stack.  I've written a lot of Rack middleware and think it's great in Ruby.

Node and Javascript provide a rich event based structure for building applications.  Node is an event loop.  It's built for events.  Node will take a request from the event queue, and process it for as long as it holds the callstack which is until the function finishes.

A callstack based approach is therefore flawed inside Node.js.  Inside an event loop we should be doing small pieces of work and then putting the next piece on the queue.  In this way, we get concurrency.  Whilst you may not be interested in concurrency for multiple requests, you can perform many different tasks via events on the event loop.  This type of concurrency is very valuable.

Chain then, is a convention for designing applications for the web inside node.js.  There's some code thrown in to help doing this.  Chain forces the use of events between links (middleware) by using events as a way to pass the request forward.  It also uses callbacks if you're interested in modifying the output on the way "back up"

Very simply:

Each link should listen to itself for a "request" event, from which it will receive exactly 1 argument.  The Chain.Environment instance.

* To pass the request forward use environment.send(nextApp)
* To finish and pass back up the stack use environment.done()
* To finish the request just respond to the client directly (use sparingly)

To start your application use

Chain.run(app)
